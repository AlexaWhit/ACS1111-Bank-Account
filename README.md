# ACS1111: Bank Account

## Description
Using object-oriented programming concepts, I created a Python program that simulates a bank account with the ability to:
- deposit
- withdraw
- add interest
- print statement

Each bank account includes:
1. Full Name
2. Randomly generate 8 digit account number
3. Account balance (which starts at 0 unless otherwise stated)

## Usage
Run `python3 bankaccount.py` and follow the prompts!
